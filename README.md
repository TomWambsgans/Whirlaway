<h1 align="center">Whirlaway üêé</h1>

A hash-based SNARK with lightweight proofs, powered by the [Whir](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1586) Polynomial Commitment Scheme.

## Specifications

- **Arithmetization**: AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation) with preprocessed columns
- **Proof size**: 150 / 200 KiB (with 128 bits of proven security)
- **Proving speed**: ~70.000 poseidon2/s (field = koala-bear, gpu = RTX 3060 Mobile)

Being hash-based, the protocol is presumably post-quantum safe.

> **Note**: This library is under construction and not production-ready.

> Roadmap: Phase 1 = Speed. Phase 2 = Code quality.

## Proving System

The core argument builds upon [SuperSpartan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/552.pdf) (Srinath Setty, Justin Thaler, Riad Wahby), with AIR-specific optimizations developed by William Borgeaud in [A simple multivariate AIR argument inspired by SuperSpartan](https://solvable.group/posts/super-air/#fnref:1).

Key techniques:
- AIR table committed as a single multilinear polynomial
- Multiple column openings batched into a single PCS opening via the sumcheck protocol
- "Ring-switching" from [Binius' 2nd paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/504.pdf) eliminates field "embedding overhead" in the PCS
