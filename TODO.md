- WHIR univariate skip
- inverse folding ordering in WHIR to enable Packing during sumcheck
- one can "move out" the variable of the eq(.) polynomials out of the sumcheck computation in WHIR (as done in the PIOP)
- Extension field: dim 5/6
- Structured AIR: often no all the columns use both up/down -> one can only provide the used columns to speed up the PIOP zerocheck
- use RowMAjorMatrix instead of Vec<Vec> for witness
- Fill Poseidon tables during bytecode execution
- Use Univariate Skip to commit to tables with k.2^n rows (k small)
